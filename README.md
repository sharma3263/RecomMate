# E-commerce Recommendation System

### Overview

The **E-commerce Recommendation System** is a content-based recommendation engine built using Flask. It allows users to receive product recommendations based on a selected product and the number of recommendations desired. The recommendations are generated using product similarity features, making it easier for users to discover relevant items in an e-commerce platform.

### Features

- **Content-Based Recommendations:** Recommends products based on similarity with the selected product.
- **Dynamic Input:** Allows users to input the product ID and the number of desired recommendations.
- **Web-Based Interface:** Simple and intuitive form for user interaction.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to any e-commerce dataset.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask** (Python Web Framework)
- **HTML/Jinja2** (Templates for front-end UI)
- **Python** (Backend logic and recommendation algorithms)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed and the necessary packages.

- **Python 3.x** 
- **Flask** 

You can install Flask by running the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-recommendation-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ecommerce-recommendation-system
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Project Structure

```
├── app.py
├── templates

└── README.md
```

- **app.py:** Contains the main Flask application and the recommendation logic.
- **templates/**: HTML templates for the user interface.
  - **form.html**: Input form for the product ID and the number of recommendations.
  - **recommendations.html**: Displays the recommended products.
- **static/**: Holds static files like CSS for styling the frontend.

### Usage

1. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommendations` in your browser.
2. Enter the **Product ID** and the **number of recommendations** you want.
3. Click **Submit** to view the recommendations based on your input.

### Customization

#### Dataset Integration

Replace the `train_data` in `app.py` with your own product dataset. The dataset should include fields like product IDs, names, descriptions, and any other content-based attributes.

Example:
```python
train_data = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Product A", "description": "This is a great product A"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Product B", "description": "This is a great product B"},
    # Add your product data here
]
```

#### Recommendation Algorithm

The content-based recommendation algorithm currently uses a placeholder. You can enhance it by integrating real algorithms such as **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity** for better accuracy.

### Future Enhancements

- **Improve Algorithm:** Use TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for content-based filtering.
- **Database Integration:** Replace the static dataset with a database for scalability.
- **Add Collaborative Filtering:** Combine content-based and collaborative filtering methods for better recommendations.
